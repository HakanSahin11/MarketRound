# MarketRound 

Current project was made as a school group project, where i was working as the backend developer of the project.
Our group utilized the project managing SCRUM method for all the planning and work throughout the process. 
My primary role in the SCRUM was to be the Project Owner, making the plannings phase / tasks, issues and while also being the primary backend developer.
All the SCRUM planning can be accessed through the "Projects" tab, with all our info.
